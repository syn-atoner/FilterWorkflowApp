## Pro Tips

### Image Selection

- **High Resolution:** Start with high-quality images (at least 1000x1000px)
- **Composition:** Consider how images will look with filters applied
- **Lighting:** Well-lit images work better with most filters

### Filter Strategy

- **Less is More:** Start with 1-2 filters
- **Order Matters:** Filters are applied in the order you check them
- **Test Variations:** Try different parameter values
- **Save Your Settings:** Take notes of filter combinations you like

### Export Best Practices

- **Format:** PNG for best quality (no compression artifacts)

- **Backup:** Keep original unfiltered images
- **Multiple Versions:** Export variations to compare

### Workflow for Music Projects

1. **Plan Your Visual Identity**
   - What mood does your music convey?
   - Choose 2-3 filter combinations that match

2. **Batch Process**
   - Upload all images for a project at once
   - Apply same filters to maintain consistency
   - Export all versions

3. **Social Media Ready**
   - Create square versions (800x800) for Instagram
   - Create wide versions (1920x1080) for YouTube
   - Create vertical (1080x1920) for Stories/Reels
